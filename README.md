# RFID Trolley System using Arduino Uno
To minimise waiting time of customers for billing products using RFID Technology, through which products can be scanned and billed in this system providing ease of transaction.

## Working of RFID trolley system

As the customer goes on adding products, all products are detected by the RFID Reader module and therefore the total price will increase accordingly.

In case if customer changes his/her mind and doesnâ€™t want any product added in the trolley he/she can remove it and the price added will be deducted automatically. The buzzer would rise at a higher voltage when the product containing RFID will be scanned across the MFRC-522 RFID reader, thus adding the product to the total sum. 

At the end of shopping the customer would press the button adding up all the products along with their price and giving the total amount to be paid on the 16x2 LCD display.
