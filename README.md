# RFID Trolley System using Arduino Uno
To minimise waiting time of customers for billing products using RFID Technology, through which products can be scanned and billed in this system providing ease of transaction.

## Working of RFID trolley system

As the customer goes on adding products, all products are detected by the RFID Reader module and therefore the total price will increase accordingly.

In case if customer changes his/her mind and doesnâ€™t want any product added in the trolley he/she can remove it and the price added will be deducted automatically. 

At the end of shopping the customer will press the button which when pressed adds all the product along with their price and gives the total amount to be paid.
